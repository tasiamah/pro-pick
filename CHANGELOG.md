## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Monorepo structure (`backend/` + `mobile/`).
- FastAPI skeleton with health, dashboard, matches, predictions, value-bets
  and analytics endpoints.
- Alembic database migrations with initial schema (competitions, teams,
  matches, odds, predictions, value bets).
- Docker Compose setup for local PostgreSQL + API with automatic migrations.
- Supabase managed PostgreSQL setup guide in `backend/README.md` and
  `.env.example` (Session pooler, secrets in `.env` only).
- CI pipeline (GitHub Actions) with three stages: lint, unit tests and
  integration tests against PostgreSQL.
- Ruff configuration for linting and formatting; pytest split into
  `tests/unit/` and `tests/integration/` with markers.
- Changelog enforcement: PRs must update `CHANGELOG.md` (or carry the
  `skip-changelog` label).
- Expo + React Native + TypeScript app in `mobile/` with bottom-tab navigation
  skeleton (Dashboard, Matches, Favorites, Analytics); ESLint and typecheck
  scripts for CI.
- Mobile navigation: Home / Matches / Favorites stacks with match detail routes,
  dark tab bar with icons aligned to the Pro Pick demo (PP-76).
- Mobile API client with TypeScript types and TanStack Query hooks for all
  backend endpoints (`/dashboard`, `/matches`, `/predictions`, `/value-bets`,
  `/analytics`).
- Central mobile theme: semantic demo colors, typography, spacing, and radii
  tokens with shared screen styles (PP-77).

### Changed
- Mobile screens and navigation now consume shared theme tokens instead of
  hardcoded values (PP-77).
- Mobile tab label **Dashboard** renamed to **Home** (PP-76).
- Standardized on Python 3.11 (CI, Docker, `pyproject.toml`,
  `.python-version`).
- Backend startup uses Alembic migrations instead of `create_all` at runtime.
- Docker Compose database credentials parameterized via environment variables.
- `.env.example` uses explicit localhost CORS origins instead of a wildcard.
- Remaining Dutch comment in `alembic/env.py` translated to English.

### Fixed
- `mobile/LICENSE` copyright updated from Expo template text to Pro Pick.
